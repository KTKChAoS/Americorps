# Flutter Web: Firebase Authentication and Google Sign in

This is a demo application to incorporate Firebase Authentication and Google Sign in for a Flutter Web application.

hosted on: https://explore-7f107.web.app

If we dont meet with you (Spring 2021 team) for some reason, contact Kartik Singhal at Kartik.Singhal@utdallas.edu
or, preferably, KTKChAoS#2225 at discord so I can give you access to the Firebase account used. Otherwise, you can make your own firebase account and project and replace the API keys in index.html

Functions to add:
1. An admin account interface, to view reports and stuff instead of submitting them, and to create accounts
2. Proper authentication, i.e, dont let anyone with a google account be able to sign in
3. A complete reporting feature for volunteers to submit their "stories" (project reports)
4. clock in clock out system instead of just submitting number of hours
